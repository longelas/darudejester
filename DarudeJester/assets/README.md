# Darude Jester
Makes the jesters cranking Darude - Sandstorm<br>
Also allows to configure if you want to enable the intro/solo, as well as change their volume

If you really want to, it's also possible to change the intro/solo to your own audio,<br>
all you have to do is replace `intro.wav` or `solo.wav` with something of your liking

## Manual Installation
1. Install BepInEx
2. Install LCSoundTool
3. Extract `DarudeJester.dll`, `intro.wav` and `solo.wav` into the `plugins` folder of BepInEx (Preferably into a separate folder)
